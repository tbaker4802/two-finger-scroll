Hi!
This is a alternative Synaptics Touch-Pad driver which Someone else created. I have modified it to work on windows 8.1 but it is by far not my main project.  If you have questions or wish to contribute feel free to join in, use the issue tracker.  I also use a github / chromium extension called 

This project aims at providing a tool for Windows platform adding some useful two finger gestures to Synaptics TouchPads. These TouchPads can be found in many todays laptops and many of them support multiple finger gestures.

Currently supported gestures:
  * Two finger scrolling - scroll vertically by sliding two fingers anywhere on the TouchPad
  * Two finger tapping - tap with two fingers to simulate a selected mouse button
If you have any questions just let me know and i'll do my best to answer.

Thanks!
